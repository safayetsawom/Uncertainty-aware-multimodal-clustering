# Uncertainty-aware-multimodal-clustering
A non-deterministic unsupervised neural network implementation for multimodal clustering of image-caption pairs using Bayesian deep learning principles. This project demonstrates uncertainty quantification in clustering tasks through stochastic embeddings and variational inference.
